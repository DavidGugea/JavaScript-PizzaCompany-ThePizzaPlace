# JavaScript-PizzaCompany-ThePizzaPlace
Hello !
In this project I learned some basic-intermediate JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills.
This is a prototype of a project of a company that sells pizza. 
There are different types of pizza and you can access and buy them, by clicking on the little photos.
I added a lot of transitions and blur effects and other cool stuff. Check out the code :D.
For more information or questions, contact me !
